    Verify and inspect data in the 'places' table of the database.

    Workflow:
        1. Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database.
        2. Execute SQL queries to:
            - Count the total rows in the 'places' table.
            - Group rows by 'types' and count the occurrences.
            - Preview the first 10 rows of the 'places' table.
        3. Print the results of each query.
        4. Handle any exceptions that occur during database operations.
        5. Ensure the database connection is closed after execution.

    Raises:
        Exception: For any errors that occur during database interaction.
