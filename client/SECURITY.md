# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and practices implemented in the Navigate LA 28 client application to ensure the protection of user data and prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Dependency Security

#### Updated Dependencies
- **TypeScript**: Using compatible version 4.9.5 with strict type checking
- **ESLint**: Version 8.57.1 with security rules enabled
- **React & Dependencies**: Latest secure versions of React 18.3.1 and related packages
- **Chart.js**: Updated to 4.5.0 for visualization security
- **Axios**: Updated to 1.7.9 for secure HTTP requests

#### Security Rules Enabled
- `no-eval`: Prevents use of eval() function
- `no-implied-eval`: Prevents implied eval usage
- `no-new-func`: Prevents dynamic function creation
- `no-script-url`: Prevents javascript: URLs
- `no-alert`: Warns against alert usage
- `no-console`: Warns against console statements in production

### 2. Input Sanitization

The application includes comprehensive input sanitization utilities in `src/utils/securityUtils.ts`:

- **XSS Prevention**: Removes script tags and dangerous HTML
- **URL Validation**: Validates URLs and blocks dangerous protocols
- **HTML Escaping**: Properly escapes HTML entities
- **Email Validation**: Sanitizes and validates email addresses
- **Filename Validation**: Prevents directory traversal attacks

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP)

A comprehensive CSP header is configured to:
- Restrict script sources to self and trusted domains
- Block inline scripts except where necessary
- Prevent data: and javascript: URLs
- Control image and font sources
- Block object and embed elements

### 4. Build Security

#### Environment Configuration
- Source maps disabled in production (`GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false`)
- Inline runtime chunks disabled for security
- Browser telemetry disabled
- Memory optimization configured

#### Dependency Resolution
- Forced resolution of vulnerable packages:
  - `nth-check >= 2.0.1`
  - `postcss >= 8.4.31`
  - `webpack-dev-server >= 4.0.0`

### 5. Code Quality & Security

#### TypeScript Configuration
- Strict type checking enabled
- `noImplicitAny` enforced
- `strictNullChecks` enabled
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` for array safety

#### ESLint Security Rules
- Comprehensive rule set for security best practices
- Import/export validation
- React-specific security rules
- Accessibility rules (WCAG 2.2 AA compliance)

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. Development vs Production

- HTTP URLs are allowed for localhost in development
- HTTPS enforced in production
- Different validation rules for development convenience

### 2. Third-Party Dependencies

Some legacy dependencies in react-scripts contain known vulnerabilities:
- **nth-check**: RegEx DoS vulnerability (mitigated by forced resolution)
- **postcss**: Line return parsing error (mitigated by forced resolution)
- **webpack-dev-server**: Source code exposure (development only)

These vulnerabilities are:
- Limited to development environment
- Mitigated through dependency resolution forcing
- Monitored for updates

### 3. Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers required for crypto.getRandomValues()
- Fallbacks provided where possible
- Security features may degrade gracefully in older browsers

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always use the security utils for user input
2. **URL Handling**: Validate all URLs before use
3. **XSS Prevention**: Escape HTML content appropriately
4. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and monitor security advisories
5. **Testing**: Include security test cases for all input handling

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Use secure environment variable management
2. **HTTPS**: Ensure all production traffic uses HTTPS
3. **Headers**: Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor for security vulnerabilities and attacks
5. **Updates**: Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches

## Incident Response

### Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security@navigate-la28.org]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response before public disclosure

### Response Timeline

- **Critical**: 24 hours
- **High**: 72 hours
- **Medium**: 1 week
- **Low**: 2 weeks

## Compliance

This application implements security measures to comply with:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy requirements
- **WCAG 2.2 AA**: Accessibility standards
- **Security Standards**: Industry best practices for web application security
